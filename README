Here you can find my scripts (recipes) for the game fold.it!

Tutorial or Tips for my Scripts:
lws:
Settings:
maxiter: use higher number for a better gain but script needs a longer time
start_* / end_* / b_*: adjust for your needs
step / gain: adjust a lower value to get the lws script working on high evo- / solos

Fuze:
fastfuze: not recommend to set to true, false will get all points out of the puzzle

Mutating:
b_m_new: will get another structure! so just give it a shot if you want ;)
b_m_fuze: will use the different methods of fuzing. if false then just a 0.1 shake the wiggle out faster with false more points with true
